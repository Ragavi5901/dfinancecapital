          D Finance Island in the United Arab Emirates has been a
          historical centre for pearl diving, the treasure trove of the
          region. In the 20th century, the UAE has reinvented itself as a
          global centre of oil production; in the 21st century, it has
          diversified to become a global center for financial services
          and a regional powerhouse for investment.

          D Finance Capital intends to build on the region’s heritage
          of unearthing hidden value, by bringing to light a new

          exploring the region’s inherent wealth.
